# BankChurn_KaggleProject
Bank Churn Project
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict which bank customers are at risk of churning (closing their accounts). Churn is a costly problem for banks, as it can lead to lost revenue and increased customer acquisition costs. By identifying customers who are likely to churn, banks can take proactive measures to retain them, such as offering targeted incentives or improving customer service.

Project Overview
The project will involve the following steps:

Data Acquisition: Collect a dataset of historical customer data from a bank. The dataset should include information about customer demographics, account activity, and churn status.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Clean and pre-process the data to remove missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This may involve imputing missing values, scaling numerical data, and encoding categorical data.

Feature Engineering: Change the features from the existing data that may be predictive of churn.

Model Selection and Training: Train a machine learning model to predict churn. The model should be evaluated on its ability to correctly predict churn status for unseen data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model into production so that it can be used to predict churn for new customers.

Technologies Used
The project will use the following technologies:

1-Python 
2-Pandas
3-NumPy
4-Scikit-learn
5-Matplotlib
6-Seaborn
